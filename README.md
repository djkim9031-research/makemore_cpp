# makemore_cpp
c++ implementation of makemore.

Given the name.txt, the repo implements the neural network logic from scratch to generate names that sound plausible.
C++ LibTorch and Matplotlib-cpp are used.
Implemented models are:
1. Bigram model distribution model.
2. Multi layer peceptron logic from scratch, then building up nn layers.
3. Manual backpropagation logic.
4. Visulization utility functions to plot nonlinear function's activation output distribution, learned embedding space vector distribution (only in 2D space), and bigram plot.
